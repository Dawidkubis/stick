I won't be working on this project anymore since I've found
other web frameworks that serve my purposes well.

# stick
create fast and simple http servers

## the orgin story
I use [rocket](https://rocket.rs) and I fairly like it, however, 
I hate how big it is.
So I decided to write my own version for the sake of simplicity.
As of now, this project is work in progress.
